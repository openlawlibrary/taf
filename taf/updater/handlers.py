class GitUpdater(handlers.MetadataUpdater):
    """
    This class implements parts of the update process specific to keeping
    metadata files and targets in a git repository. The vast majority of the
    update process is handled by TUF's updater. This class does not modify
    and of TUF's validation functionalities - it only handles loading of
    files.
    One substantial difference between our system and how TUF is designed lies in the
    fact that we want to validate every commit and not just check if the most recent
    one contains valid metadata. We want to check if the metadata was valid at the time
    when it was committed.

    Since we do not want to change the clients repository until
    we know it is safe to use git pull, the update works as follows:
    - The repository containing the metadata files is cloned to the temp folder.
    - The most recent commit in the client's local repository is determined. Based
    on that all new commits (newer than the client's most recent one in the
    cloned repository) are found.
    - A commit is considered to be a TUF mirror. We keep track of the current commit.
    - This class is designed in such a way that for each subsequent call of the
    updater's refresh method the next commit is used as a mirror. This is better than
    instantiating this class multiple times as that seems to require less modifications
    of TUF's code.
    - The updater's method '_get_metadata_file' call 'get_mirrors'. It then iterates
    through these mirrors and tries to update a metadata file by downloading them
    from each mirror, until a valid metadata is downloaded. If none of the mirrors
    contains valid metadata, an exception is raised. So, what we want to do is to
    return the current commit, and just the current commit. This means that that an
    exception will be raised if the version of the metadata file at that commit
    is not valid.
    - The same logic is used to handle targets.


    Attributes:
        - repository_directory: the client's local repository's location
        - current_path: path of the 'current' directory needed by the updater
        - previous_path: path of the 'previous' directory needed by the updater
        - validation_auth_repo: a fresh clone of the metadata repository. It is
        a bare git repository. An instance of the `BareGitRepo` class.
        - users_auth_repo: an instance of the `GitRepo` class. The user's current
        git repository.
        - commits: a list of commits, starting with the most recent commit in the
        user's repository. The following commits are those committed after the
        the top one if the client's repo.
        - commits_indexes: a dictionary which stores index of the current commit
        per metadata file. The reason for separating the metadata files is that
        not all files are updated at the same time.
